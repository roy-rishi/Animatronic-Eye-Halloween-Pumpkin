This is a repository of the files necessary to reproduce the project featured in [this instructable](https://www.instructables.com/A-Halloween-Pumpkin-With-a-Moving-Animatronic-Eye-/). Go check it out! Or, if you'd like, watch the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj-_afTFLtg).

In the Instructable, you will learn how to make a pumpkin that shocks everyone - either from terror or stupefaction. Optionally, connect an ultrasonic sensor and set the trigger distance so that your pumpkin jump scares anyone who dares to take treats from your house!

In the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xj-_afTFLtg), you will see a demonstration of the movements that the eye is currently capable of. The first 2 clips feature the random twitchy movements that the eye can be programmed to do, and the 3rd and 4th clips show how the pumpkin can roll its eye in the same way that a human might when annoyed.

This was a Halloween rush-project for me, so rather than waiting for a universal joint to ship, I designed an eye joint that doesn't require any hard-to-source parts. You can complete this project in just 1 day, making it great for a last second attempt to out-pumpkin your neighbors!
